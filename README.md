GameServer

This is a simple http webserver with embedded servlets.
This server contains a servlet, which is handle the players actions.
- You can put it in the launcher as a widget.
- You can set the log type.
- You can set the port of the server.
- You can use it as an own game and web server if you change the index.html in the SDCard/gameServerRoot.
After start it shows the address, you can set this address in the amoba setting and you can play with your friends.
I suggest to turn on in the phone developer setting the stay awake option, and put the phone on charger.
